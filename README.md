The innovative project iTraffic Harmony uses design thinking and innovation to completely transform traffic management. By combining artificial intelligence, predictive modeling, and smart infrastructure, the initiative tries to improve traffic mobility in urban areas. iTraffic Harmony aims to improve traffic flow, reduce congestion, and boost overall transportation efficiency by creating a comprehensive system that examines traffic patterns, forecasts congestion, and dynamically optimizes signal timings. This creative approach creates a smooth and peaceful traffic experience by fusing real-time data, machine learning algorithms, and responsive infrastructure. For the sake of travelers and the environment, the project imagines a future in which cities might accomplish sustainable, intelligent, and synchronized traffic management.

The main features include:
Traffic flow prediction based on historical data (traffic forecast)
Traffic signal optimization (signal timings according to real time traffic)
Traffic incident detection (congestion due to accidents, rallies, protests etc)
